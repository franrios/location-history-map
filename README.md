# My Trips

Using `react-map-gl` and `deck.gl` libraries you can render awesome maps UI. I get my location history points from Google and create a small project to render some layers on a map. I simplified the project just to contain the data related to the last three months of 2017 but feel free to use this code to render anything you want.
